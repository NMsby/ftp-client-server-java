# FTP Client-Server System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

The FTP Client-Server system follows a distributed architecture with clear separation between server and client components, communicating over TCP/IP network protocols.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 System Components
- **FTP Server**: Multi-threaded server handling client connections
- **Command-Line Client**: Text-based interface for FTP operations
- **GUI Client**: Graphical interface for user-friendly operations
- **Common Protocol Layer**: Shared definitions and utilities

### 2.2 Communication Protocol
- **Transport Layer**: TCP/IP sockets for reliable communication
- **Application Layer**: FTP protocol implementation
- **Data Transfer**: Separate data connections for file transfers

## 3. Server Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components
- **Server Main**: Entry point and server initialization
- **Connection Manager**: Handles incoming client connections
- **Client Handler**: Processes individual client sessions
- **Command Processor**: Interprets and executes FTP commands
- **File Manager**: Handles file system operations
- **Authentication Manager**: Manages user authentication

### 3.2 Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: Accepts incoming connections
- **Worker Threads**: Handle individual client sessions
- **Thread Pool**: Manages concurrent client connections
- **Synchronization**: Ensures thread-safe operations

## 4. Client Architecture

### 4.1 Command-Line Client
- **Client Main**: Entry point and connection management
- **Command Parser**: Interprets user commands
- **Protocol Handler**: Manages FTP protocol communication
- **File Transfer Manager**: Handles upload/download operations

### 4.2 GUI Client
- **Main Window**: Primary user interface
- **File Browser**: Local and remote file system views
- **Transfer Manager**: Visual progress tracking
- **Event Handlers**: User interaction processing

## 5. Common Components

### 5.1 Protocol Definitions
- **FTP Commands**: Command constants and formats
- **Response Codes**: Standard FTP response definitions
- **Message Types**: Request/response message structures

### 5.2 Utilities
- **File Utilities**: File operations and validation
- **Network Utilities**: Socket and connection helpers
- **Configuration**: System configuration management
- **Logging**: Centralized logging framework

## 6. Data Flow

### 6.1 Client Connection Flow
1. Client initiates connection to server
2. Server accepts connection and creates client handler
3. Authentication handshake occurs
4. Client sends commands, server responds
5. File transfers use separate data connections
6. Connection terminates gracefully

### 6.2 File Transfer Flow
1. Client requests file transfer (RETR/STOR)
2. Server establishes data connection
3. File data streams over data connection
4. Transfer progress is monitored
5. Connection closes upon completion

## 7. Error Handling Strategy

### 7.1 Network Errors
- Connection timeout handling
- Socket exception recovery
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### 7.2 File System Errors
- Permission denied handling
- File not found responses
- Disk space validation

### 7.3 Protocol Errors
- Invalid command responses
- Authentication failures
- Malformed request handling

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Authentication
- Username/password validation
- Session management
- Access control enforcement

### 8.2 File Access Control
- Directory traversal prevention
- File permission validation
- Secure file operations

## 9. Performance Optimization

### 9.1 Concurrent Processing
- Multi-threading for scalability
- Connection pooling
- Resource management

### 9.2 Memory Management
- Efficient file streaming
- Buffer management
- Garbage collection optimization

## 10. Future Enhancements

### 10.1 Security Enhancements
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Certificate-based authentication
- Secure file transfer protocols

### 10.2 Feature Extensions
- Resume interrupted transfers
- Bandwidth throttling
- Advanced user management
