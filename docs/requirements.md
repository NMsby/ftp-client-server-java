# FTP Client-Server Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Implement a comprehensive FTP client-server system that demonstrates distributed systems concepts including client-server architecture, network communication, concurrency, and file transfer protocols.

### 1.2 Scope
- Develop a multi-threaded FTP server
- Create both command-line and GUI FTP clients
- Support standard FTP commands and file operations
- Demonstrate local and remote communication
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 FTP Server Requirements

- **FR-S3**: Support directory navigation (LIST, CWD, PWD)
- **FR-S4**: Handle file uploads (STOR command)
- **FR-S5**: Handle file downloads (RETR command)
- **FR-S6**: Support file management (DELE, MKD, RMD, RNFR, RNTO)
- **FR-S7**: Provide file information (SIZE, MDTM)
- **FR-S8**: Handle graceful connection termination (QUIT)
- **FR-S9**: Log all client activities and server events

### 2.2 FTP Client Requirements
